# Breast Cancer Detection System

## Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation of a **Breast Cancer Detection System** using machine learning. The system is trained to predict whether a patient is likely to have breast cancer based on clinical data. The goal of this project is to assist in the early detection of breast cancer by analyzing input features such as tumor characteristics and other relevant medical data.

The project also includes sample screenshots of the systemâ€™s interface, showing how users can interact with the model to get predictions.
